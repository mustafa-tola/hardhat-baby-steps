<h1>Introduction to Hardhat</h1>

<h2>What is Hardhat</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://hardhat.org/">Hardhat</a> is a development environment for Ethereum software that allows developers to compile, edit, debug, and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network</li>
    <li>There are some major components of Hardhat which are as follows: -
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview">Hardhat Runner</a> ( Helps in managing and automating recurrent tasks which helps in developing smart contracts and dapps )</li>
            <li><a href="https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview">HardHat Network</a> ( Local Ethereum Development Enviroment used to deploy and test smart contracts locally ) </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Difference between Hardhat and Truffle</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hardhat and Truffle are both used for compiling and deploying smart contracts. The main differences betwene the two are as follows: -
        <ol>
            <li>It is easier to migrate from truffle to hardhat while it is difficult in vice versa version</li>

            <li>Hardhat is easier to debug while Truffle is harder to debug</li>
        </ol>
